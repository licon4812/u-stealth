# u-stealth

u-stealth is a legacy tool for allowing for drives to be hidden so that the wii-u doesn't hound the user for formatting.

It has been migrated from Windows Forms targeting .NET Framework 3.5 to Windows Forms for .NET 9.0.

I plan on migrating it to the windows app sdk in the future. For more modern UI and for Native AOT and trimming.
