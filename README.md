# u-stealth

u-stealth is a legacy tool for allowing for drives to be hidden so that the wii-u doesn't hound the user for formatting.

It has been migrated from Windows Forms targeting .NET Framework 3.5 to Windows Forms for .NET 9.0.

I plan on migrating it to the windows app sdk in the future. For more modern UI and for Native AOT and trimming.

## U-Stealth

U-Stealth has been rebuilt in the windows app sdk and is available here:

### Microsoft Store

</a>

### WinGet

`winget install 9PP5QM8RK8XQ`

## U-Stealth CLI

The U-Stealth CLI is a command-line interface for managing U-Stealth settings and configurations. It allows users to perform actions without the need for a graphical interface.

### Windows 

#### WinGet

`winget install 9P1TXW2R0R4T`

#### Microsoft Store

<a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9P1TXW2R0R4T?mode=direct">

</a>

### Linux
I have not published this package to any package manager as of yet. I will look into publishing it to snap or apt in the future.
For now you will have to download the executable from the releases page on this repo.

## WinUI.Table View

A modern table view control for WinUI applications. I have cloned this repo and added it as a project reference for UStealth.WinUI/
This was due to the table not supporting WinRT interop bindings. I have made a PR to the original repo to add this functionality.

- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/w-ahmad/WinUI.TableView)
- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/w-ahmad/WinUI.TableView/issues/207)
- [Pull Request](https://github.com/w-ahmad/WinUI.TableView/pull/209)

One the PR is merged I will remove the project reference and add it as a nuget package.
