# u-stealth

u-stealth is a legacy tool for allowing for drives to be hidden so that the wii-u doesn't hound the user for formatting.

It has been migrated from Windows Forms targeting .NET Framework 3.5 to Windows Forms for .NET 9.0.

I plan on migrating it to the windows app sdk in the future. For more modern UI and for Native AOT and trimming.

## U-Stealth

U-Stealth has been rebuilt in the windows app sdk and is available here:

</a>

### WinGet

`winget install 9PP5QM8RK8XQ`

## U-Stealth CLI

The U-Stealth CLI is a command-line interface for managing U-Stealth settings and configurations. It allows users to perform actions without the need for a graphical interface.

### WinGet

Coming soon
